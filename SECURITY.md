# Security Analysis - SalisToken

## Security Features

### 1. Access Control
- **Owner Functions**: Critical functions are restricted to contract owner
- **Role Management**: Clear separation of admin and user functions
- **Function Visibility**: Proper use of public, external, and internal modifiers

### 2. Supply Management
- **Max Supply Cap**: Hard-coded maximum supply prevents inflation
- **Minting Limits**: Owner can only mint up to max supply
- **Supply Tracking**: Accurate tracking of total and remaining supply

### 3. Blacklist System
- **Transfer Prevention**: Blacklisted addresses cannot send or receive tokens
- **Owner Control**: Only owner can modify blacklist
- **Status Verification**: Proper checking of blacklist status

### 4. Token Locking
- **Time-based Locks**: Tokens can be locked for specific time periods
- **Transfer Prevention**: Locked tokens cannot be transferred
- **Automatic Release**: Locks automatically expire after time period

### 5. Pausable Functionality
- **Emergency Pause**: Owner can pause all transfers
- **Minting Pause**: Separate control for minting operations
- **Resume Functionality**: Owner can resume operations

## Known Limitations

### 1. Centralization Risks
- **Owner Privileges**: Owner has significant control over the contract
- **Single Point of Failure**: Loss of owner keys could be problematic
- **Admin Functions**: Multiple admin functions could be consolidated

### 2. Gas Considerations
- **Complex Functions**: Some functions may have high gas costs
- **Batch Operations**: Large batch operations could hit gas limits
- **Storage Optimization**: Some storage patterns could be optimized

### 3. Upgradeability
- **No Upgrade Mechanism**: Contract is not upgradeable
- **Immutable Logic**: Contract logic cannot be changed after deployment
- **Bug Fixes**: Critical bugs would require new contract deployment

## Recommendations

### 1. Access Control
- Consider implementing multi-signature for critical functions
- Add time-locks for admin functions
- Implement role-based access control

### 2. Gas Optimization
- Optimize storage patterns
- Consider batch operation limits
- Implement gas-efficient loops

### 3. Monitoring
- Implement comprehensive event logging
- Add monitoring for critical functions
- Consider circuit breakers for emergency situations
